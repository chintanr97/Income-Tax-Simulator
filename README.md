These benefits or tax deductions are not applicable in the New Income Tax Regime. However, the difference in the income tax rates between the 2 regimes allow taxpayers to adjust between thier investments while staying in old regimes with higher tax rates or moving to new regime without any tax deductions and incurring less tax rates. These benefits leverage out when the surcharge on the gross taxable income increases as per the new tax regime compared to old one.

## Policy of Usage

The simulator is only an indicative to the income tax amount that you might have to pay based on either of the tax regimes. The actual amount of income tax depends upon the income available in Form 26A and all the investments made during the FY, while filing the Income Tax Return (ITR).
